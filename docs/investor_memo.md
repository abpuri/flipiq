## 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

FlipIQ is building the first AI-powered, proactive opportunity detection platform for house flippers. The US house flipping market represents $118B in annual transaction volume, with 308,000+ active investors who currently rely on reactive, manual research tools that cost them 40+ hours per month and cause them to miss the majority of emerging opportunities.

### The Solution

Our platform deploys autonomous AI agents that monitor 26,000+ US ZIP codes daily, applying proprietary scoring algorithms to identify high-potential flip opportunities before they become obvious to the broader market. Unlike existing tools that require manual searching and filtering, FlipIQ proactively alerts investors to emerging opportunities 30-60 days ahead of competitors.

### Traction

We have built a functional MVP with:
- Full coverage of 26,307 US ZIP codes
- Proprietary 5-factor scoring engine with 3 strategy presets
- 6 autonomous AI agents (data refresh, scoring, detection, analysis, alerting, reporting)
- Interactive dashboard with 6 analysis tabs
- 90-day simulation demonstrating system effectiveness (503 opportunities detected, 538 alerts generated)

### The Ask

We are raising $750,000 in seed funding at a $3-4M pre-money valuation to:
- Complete product development (live data integration, mobile app)
- Acquire first 1,000 paying customers
- Build core team (VP Engineering, Head of Growth)
- Achieve path to profitability within 18 months

### Investment Thesis

1. **Large, growing market** with $285M SAM and 8-12% CAGR
2. **Broken incumbent solutions** that are reactive, manual, and fragmented
3. **Defensible technology moat** through agent architecture and data network effects
4. **Strong unit economics** with 5.4:1 LTV:CAC and 82% gross margins
5. **Experienced founding team** with complementary skills and execution velocity
6. **Clear path to scale** with proven SaaS playbook
