## 1. Cold Email Template

### Subject Line Options:

Subject: Quick question about your flip research process

Hi [First Name],

I came across your work [on BiggerPockets / LinkedIn / at [REIA name]] and was impressed by [specific detail - recent flip, post, comment].

I'm Abhay, a business analytics grad student at UT Austin and former consultant at A&M. My co-founder Anthony and I are building FlipIQ - an AI-powered tool that helps flippers find opportunities 30-60 days before they show up on PropStream.

We're in the early stages and talking to experienced flippers like you to understand:
- How you currently research markets
- What's most frustrating about your workflow
- Whether our approach would actually help

Would you have 20 minutes for a quick call this week or next? I'd genuinely value your perspective - no sales pitch, just learning.

If you're interested, here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

Either way, congratulations on [recent success/milestone].

Best,
Abhay Puri
Co-founder, FlipIQ

## 2. LinkedIn Connection Request

### Template (300 character limit):

```
Hi [First Name] - I'm building an AI tool for house flippers and looking for experienced investors to interview. Would love 15 min to learn about your research workflow. No pitch, just trying to understand the market. Worth a quick chat?
```

### Follow-up Message (after connection accepted):

```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

As I mentioned, I'm building FlipIQ - an AI system that monitors markets and alerts flippers to opportunities before they're obvious to everyone else.

I'm talking to 20-30 experienced flippers to validate our approach. Would you be open to a 20-minute call to share your perspective on market research?

Here's my calendar if any time works: [Calendly link]

Really appreciate it either way.

Best,
Abhay

### To Your Connection:

```
Subject: Quick intro request - house flipping research

Hi [Connection Name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick ask - I noticed you're connected to [Target Name] who does [X flips/year or notable detail].

My co-founder and I are building FlipIQ, an AI-powered market research tool for house flippers. We're in customer discovery mode and trying to talk to experienced investors.

Would you be comfortable making a quick intro? I'm not trying to sell anything - just want 20 minutes to understand how flippers research markets.

Here's a blurb you can use:
---
"[Target Name], my friend Abhay is building a tool for house flippers and is looking for experienced investors to interview. He's not selling anything - just doing customer discovery. Would you be open to a quick call? I can make an intro if interested."
---

Totally understand if it's not a good fit. Really appreciate you considering it!

Best,
Abhay

Hi [First Name],

Last follow-up, I promise!

I'm trying to talk to 20 flippers before we finalize our product direction. Your experience with [specific detail] would be really valuable.

If you're open to it, here are some specific questions I'd love your take on:
- How many hours/week do you spend researching markets?
- What tools do you currently use?
- What would make your workflow 10x better?

Even a quick email response would help if a call doesn't work.

Thanks for considering it,
Abhay

P.S. - Happy to share what I'm learning from other flippers if that's interesting.
```

### Follow-Up #3 (7 days after Follow-Up #2 - Final):

Wishing you continued success with your flipping business.
