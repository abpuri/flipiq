## Section 1: Introduction (2 minutes)

### Opening Script:

```
"Hi [Name], thanks so much for taking the time! I know you're busy with [recent flip/projects].

Quick intro: I'm Abhay, building FlipIQ with my co-founder Anthony. We're both ex-consultants at A&M, and I'm finishing up my business analytics masters at UT Austin.

We're building an AI-powered tool to help flippers find opportunities faster, but we're still figuring out exactly what to build. That's why conversations like this are so valuable.

Here's the plan for the next 30 minutes:
1. I'll ask questions about how you research markets today
2. If helpful, I can show you what we're building
3. I'd love your honest feedback - good and bad

Sound good? Any questions before we dive in?"
```

### What to Listen For:
- How engaged are they? Rushed? Distracted?
- Do they ask questions back? (Sign of genuine interest)
- What's their communication style? (Adjust accordingly)

## Section 2: Discovery Questions (15 minutes)

### Part A: Background (2 min)

```
"First, help me understand your business:

1. How long have you been flipping houses?

2. How many flips did you do last year? What's your target for this year?

3. What markets do you focus on? Just local or multiple metros?"
```

**Notes:** _______________________________________________

### Part B: Current Research Workflow (5 min)

```
"Now let's talk about how you find opportunities:

4. Walk me through how you typically find a new market to flip in. What's your process?

5. How many hours per week do you spend researching markets (not individual properties)?

6. What tools do you currently use?
   - PropStream?
   - DealMachine?
   - Spreadsheets?
   - Other?

7. How much do you spend monthly on research tools?
```

**Notes:** _______________________________________________

### Part C: Pain Points (5 min)

```
"Now the frustrations:

8. What's the most frustrating part of market research?

9. When was the last time you missed an opportunity because someone else got there first?

10. Have you ever gotten into a bad deal because you missed something in the research?

11. If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about how you research markets, what would it be?"
```

**Notes:** _______________________________________________

### Part D: Desired Features (3 min)

```
"Looking ahead:

12. What would make your market research 10x faster or better?

13. Have you tried any new tools recently? What worked, what didn't?

14. If an AI could analyze every ZIP code in America and alert you to opportunities, how valuable would that be?"
```

**Notes:** _______________________________________________

---

## Section 3: Demo Walkthrough (10 minutes)

### Transition:

```
"Based on what you've shared, I think what we're building might actually help. Would you like to see a quick demo? I'll show you the dashboard and get your honest reaction."
```

### Demo Flow:

**1. Top Opportunities Tab (2 min)**
```
"This is our main view. We analyze 26,000+ ZIP codes and rank them by opportunity score.

[Point to score column]
This composite score combines 5 factors: appreciation, velocity, distress, pricing power, and value gap.

[Adjust filters]
You can filter by price range, score threshold, and geography.

What's your initial reaction?"
```

**2. Geographic View (2 min)**
```
"This shows where opportunities are concentrated.

[Point to map]
Hot spots are in red/orange. You can drill down to specific metros.

How does this compare to how you research geography today?"
```

**3. Agent Monitoring (3 min)**
```
"This is where FlipIQ really differentiates.

[Point to agent status]
We have 6 AI agents working 24/7 - they monitor data, compute scores, detect changes, analyze properties, and generate alerts.

[Show HOT alert]
These are our highest priority alerts. Each includes the reason and recommended action.

[Show Property Deep Dive]
One-click analysis that used to take 30 minutes.

What questions do you have about this?"
```

**4. Ask for Reaction (3 min)**
```
"So that's the core of what we're building.

- What stood out to you?
- What's missing?
- Is there anything that wouldn't work for your workflow?"
```

---

## Section 4: Feedback Collection (5 minutes)

### Specific Questions:

```
"Let me ask a few specific questions to help us prioritize:

15. On a scale of 1-10, how useful would this be for your business?
    [If <7, ask: "What would make it a 10?"]

16. If this were available today, would you pay for it?
    - Yes, definitely
    - Maybe, depends on price
    - Probably not
    [If yes: "What would you expect to pay monthly?"]

17. What feature would you need to see before you'd actually use this?

18. What would prevent you from using this?"
```

**Notes:** _______________________________________________

### Pricing Discovery:

```
"Our pricing tiers are $49, $149, and $499 per month.

- At $149/month (Professional tier), would you try it?
- What would it need to include to be worth $149?
- Is there a price point where it's a no-brainer?"
```

**Notes:** _______________________________________________

## Section 5: Close & Next Steps (3 minutes)

### Based on Interest Level:

**HIGH INTEREST (Would pay, score 8+):**
```
"It sounds like this could really help your business. Here's what I'd propose:

1. I'll add you to our beta list - you'll get early access before public launch
2. As a beta user, you'll get special pricing and direct input on features
3. Can I follow up in 2 weeks with access to try it?

Also - do you know 1-2 other flippers who might be interested in chatting with me?"
```

**MEDIUM INTEREST (Interested but hesitant, score 5-7):**
```
"Thanks for the honest feedback. It sounds like we need to [address specific concern] before this would work for you.

Can I keep you posted on our progress? If we add [feature they mentioned], I'd love to show you an updated version.

In the meantime, is there anyone else you know who does [X flips/year] who might want to chat?"
```

**LOW INTEREST (Skeptical, score <5):**
```
"I really appreciate your honesty. It sounds like [their current solution] is working well for you.

Can I ask - what would need to change for you to consider a new tool? Is it about the tool itself, or timing?

Either way, thanks for helping us understand the market better."
```

### Always End With:

```
"Before we wrap up:
1. Anything else you think I should know about how flippers research markets?
2. Any questions for me?

Thanks again for your time, [Name]. This was really valuable."
```

## Common Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I only flip in my local area" | "Makes sense. Would it help to see when neighboring markets are heating up? Many flippers expand once they have confidence in new areas." |
| "PropStream already does this" | "PropStream is great for property data. We're focused on market-level intelligence and proactive alerts. Think of it as complementary - we help you know where to look before you use PropStream to find specific properties." |
| "I don't trust AI" | "I hear you. Our scoring is based on real Zillow data, not black box predictions. I can walk you through exactly how each score is calculated." |
| "Too expensive" | "At what price point would it be worth trying? And what features would it need at that price?" |
| "I need to think about it" | "Totally understand. What specific things do you need to think through? Maybe I can help address them now." |
