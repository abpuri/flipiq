## Slide 1: Title

**FlipIQ**

*AI-Powered Opportunity Detection for House Flippers*

Seed Round | $750K

December 2025

---

## Slide 2: Problem

### House Flippers Are Flying Blind

**The Pain Points:**

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **40+ hours/month** on manual market research | Time that could be spent closing deals |
| **80% of opportunities missed** | Delayed data means competitors get there first |
| **Tool overload** | 3-5 subscriptions, constant context switching |
| **Reactive workflow** | Only find opportunities after they're obvious |

**Current Tools Are Broken:**

- PropStream: Filter thousands of properties manually
- DealMachine: Drive neighborhoods hoping to find deals
- Spreadsheets: Track markets by hand, miss emerging trends

> "I spend more time researching than actually flipping."
> — BiggerPockets forum user

**The Result:** Professional flippers leave $50K+ on the table annually from missed or delayed opportunities.

---

## Slide 3: Solution

### Your AI Agent Finds Deals While You Sleep

**FlipIQ: Proactive Intelligence, Not Reactive Filters**

| Old Way | FlipIQ Way |
|---------|------------|
| You search for opportunities | Opportunities come to you |
| Analyze markets manually | AI scores 26K+ ZIPs daily |
| React to obvious signals | Get alerts 30-60 days early |
| Switch between 5 tools | One integrated workflow |

**How It Works:**

1. **Set Your Criteria** — Define target markets, price range, and strategy
2. **AI Monitors 24/7** — Agent system analyzes all US ZIP codes daily
3. **Get Proactive Alerts** — HOT/WARM/WATCH priority notifications
4. **Review & Act** — Deep-dive analysis ready when you need it

**The Difference:**

> "FlipIQ told me about a market 45 days before it showed up on PropStream's radar."
> — Beta user feedback

## Pitch Delivery Notes

**Key Messages to Emphasize:**

1. **"Proactive, not reactive"** — Our core differentiator. Repeat often.

2. **"AI agents work while you sleep"** — Emotional resonance with time-starved flippers.

3. **"First mover with 18-month lead"** — Creates urgency, defensibility story.

4. **"Path to profitability in 18 months"** — Capital efficiency matters to seed investors.

5. **"We built it, not just designed it"** — Working MVP shows execution ability.

**Anticipated Questions:**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why won't PropStream just copy you? | 12-18 month architectural lead. They'd need to rebuild from scratch. |
| What's your data moat? | Network effects — more users = better model calibration. |
| How do you acquire customers? | Content + community (BiggerPockets), paid search, lender partnerships. |
| What if the housing market crashes? | Flipping volume drops but doesn't disappear. We pivot to rental investors (counter-cyclical). |
| Why such a small raise? | Capital efficiency. $750K gets us to break-even and proves the model. |
| What's the exit? | Strategic acquisition by Zillow, Redfin, CoStar, or data company. $100M+ in 5-7 years. |
