## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Philosophy

**Value-Based Pricing Rationale:**
- Average house flipper earns $66,000 gross profit per flip (ATTOM 2024)
- Active flippers complete 2.8 flips per year = $185,000 annual gross profit
- Tool cost at 0.3-1.0% of deal value is easily justifiable
- One additional deal found pays for 2-10 years of subscription

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Monthly | Annual | Target Customer | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Starter** | $49 | $470 (20% off) | Beginners, 1-3 flips/year | Basic alerts, dashboard, 5 markets |
| **Professional** | $149 | $1,430 (20% off) | Active flippers, 3-10 flips/year | Daily alerts, property analysis, unlimited markets, custom thresholds |
| **Enterprise** | $499 | $4,790 (20% off) | Firms, 10+ flips/year | API access, white-label, priority support, team seats |

### Pricing Benchmarks

| Competitor | Entry Price | Mid-Tier | High-Tier |
|------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| PropStream | $99 | $199 | $399 |
| DealMachine | $49 | $99 | $149 |

**Positioning:** Premium value, competitive entry point

### Willingness to Pay Analysis

**Survey Data (BiggerPockets forums, Reddit r/realestateinvesting):**

| Flipper Segment | Monthly Budget for Tools | Our Target Tier |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Beginners (<3 flips) | $50-100 | Starter ($49) |
| Active (3-10 flips) | $100-200 | Professional ($149) |
| Professional (10+ flips) | $200-500 | Enterprise ($499) |
| Small firms | $500-2,000 | Enterprise + custom |

**Key Insight:** Flippers are price-sensitive at entry but expand quickly once they see ROI. Land low, expand high.

## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

### LTV Calculation

**Base Assumptions:**
- ARPU: $89/month (blended across tiers)
- Gross Margin: 82%
- Monthly Churn: 4.5% (blended)
- Customer Lifetime: 22 months (1/0.045)

**LTV Formula:**
```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin × Average Lifetime)
LTV = ($89 × 0.82 × 22 months)
LTV = $1,606
```

**Conservative LTV: $1,068** (assuming 15-month lifetime, higher churn)

### LTV by Tier

| Tier | ARPU | Est. Lifetime | Gross Margin | LTV |
|------|------|---------------|--------------|-----|
| Starter | $49 | 12 months | 80% | $470 |
| Professional | $149 | 24 months | 82% | $2,930 |
| Enterprise | $499 | 36 months | 85% | $15,269 |
| **Blended** | **$89** | **22 months** | **82%** | **$1,606** |

### Churn Analysis

**Churn Benchmarks (B2B SaaS):**
- SMB SaaS median monthly churn: 5-7%
- Best-in-class SMB SaaS: 3-4%
- Enterprise SaaS: 1-2%

**Our Assumptions:**

| Tier | Monthly Churn | Annual Retention | Rationale |
|------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| Starter | 6.0% | 48% | Price-sensitive, may outgrow quickly |
| Professional | 4.0% | 61% | Sticky features, custom alerts |
| Enterprise | 2.5% | 74% | API integrations, switching costs |
| **Blended** | **4.5%** | **58%** | |

**Churn Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Onboarding program (30-day guided setup)
2. Usage monitoring (proactive outreach for low engagement)
3. Customer success team (dedicated for Professional+)
4. Quarterly feature releases (continuous value delivery)
5. Annual plans with discount (locks in 12 months)
6. Community building (forums, webinars)

Year 3: 149% growth + 25% margin = 174      ✓
```

### Magic Number Calculation

```
Magic Number = Net New ARR / Sales & Marketing Spend (prior quarter)

Year 2 Target:
Net New ARR (Q4): $400K
S&M Spend (Q3): $320K
Magic Number = 1.25  ✓
