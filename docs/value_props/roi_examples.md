```
INVESTMENT:

## ROI Calculator Inputs

For landing page calculator:

### Input Variables
| Variable | Default | Range |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Flips per year | 5 | 1-50 |
| Hours researching per flip | 15 | 5-40 |
| Hourly value | $100 | $25-$500 |

### Assumptions (Fixed)
| Assumption | Value | Justification |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Time savings % | 80% | Based on user research |
| Extra deals found | 1/year | Conservative estimate |
| Average flip profit | $40,000 | Industry average |

### Formula
```
Time Saved = Flips × Hours × 0.80
Time Value = Time Saved × Hourly Value
Extra Deal Value = 1 × $40,000
Service Cost = $149 × 12 = $1,788

Net Benefit = Time Value + Extra Deal Value - Service Cost
```

## Objection: "That ROI Seems Too Good"

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
> "I hear you - 6,000% ROI sounds aggressive. Let me break it down more conservatively."

**Conservative Scenario:**
```
VERY CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS:
- Time savings: 40% (not 80%)
- No extra deals (just time savings)
- Lowest hourly value: $50

Example for Active Flipper:
- Time saved: 624 × 0.40 = 250 hours
- Time value: 250 × $50 = $12,500
- FlipIQ cost: $1,788
- Net benefit: $10,712

Even conservatively: 499% ROI
```

**The Real Question:**
> "The real question isn't 'is this ROI possible' - it's 'will FlipIQ work for YOUR business?' That's why we offer a 14-day free trial. Test it, measure your own results, decide based on data."

## ROI Proof Points

### Evidence to Support Claims

1. **Time Savings**
   - Industry benchmark: Flippers spend 40+ hrs/month on research
   - FlipIQ users report: 15 min/day = 7.5 hrs/month
   - Reduction: 81%

2. **Extra Deals**
   - FlipIQ monitors 26K+ ZIPs vs human capacity of ~50
   - 520x more coverage = mathematically more opportunities
   - Conservative estimate: 1 extra deal/year

3. **Earlier Detection**
   - Agent system updates scores within 24 hours of data release
   - Manual research typically 2-4 weeks delayed
   - Head start: 30-60 days

4. **Risk Reduction**
   - Deep Dive analysis catches declining markets
   - User reports: "Avoided $35K loss" (David T. case study)
   - Hard to quantify but real value

## Personalized ROI Script

Use this in discovery calls:

```
"Let me calculate your specific ROI...

You said you do [X] flips per year and spend [Y] hours researching each one.
That's [X×Y] hours annually.

At your hourly value of $[Z], that's $[X×Y×Z] in research time cost.

FlipIQ typically saves 80% of that time, which is $[X×Y×Z×0.8].

Plus, if we help you find just ONE extra deal at $[profit], that's $[profit].

Your total annual benefit would be approximately $[total].

FlipIQ Professional costs $1,788/year.

So your net benefit is $[total - 1,788], and payback happens in about [days] days.

Does that math make sense for your business?"
```
