## Scene-by-Scene Script

### Scene 1: Hook (0:00 - 0:30)

**On Screen:**
- Quick cuts of a flipper at computer with multiple tabs open
- PropStream, Zillow, spreadsheets, calculator
- Frustrated expression

**NARRATION:**
```
"You're spending 40 hours a month researching markets...
[pause]
...scrolling through PropStream, building spreadsheets, checking Zillow...
[pause]
...and you're still missing 80% of the best opportunities.

By the time you find a hot market, your competition is already there."

[Logo animation: FlipIQ appears]

"What if an AI could do all that research for you... 24/7?"
```

**Graphics Needed:**

- Red "X" over missed opportunities

### Scene 2: Solution Overview (0:30 - 1:30)

**On Screen:**
- FlipIQ dashboard loading
- Animation of 6 AI agents

**NARRATION:**
```
"Meet FlipIQ - your AI-powered opportunity detection system.

[Dashboard loads]

Instead of YOU searching for opportunities, FlipIQ's autonomous agents work around the clock...

[Animation: 6 agent icons with labels]

...analyzing 26,000+ ZIP codes across America using 5 key factors:
- Appreciation: Where are prices growing?
- Velocity: How fast do homes sell?
- Distress: Where are motivated sellers?
- Pricing Power: What's the sale-to-list ratio?
- Value Gap: Where's the arbitrage?

[Score visualization appears]

Every ZIP gets a score from 0 to 100. The higher the score, the better the flip potential.

And when an opportunity emerges, YOU get alerted - not the other way around."
```

**Graphics Needed:**
- 6 agent icons with labels (Data Refresh, Scoring, Detection, Analysis, Alert, Report)
- 5-factor breakdown visualization
- Score meter animation

---

### Scene 3: Dashboard Walkthrough (1:30 - 3:30)

#### Part A: Top Opportunities (1:30 - 2:15)

**On Screen:**
- Navigate to Top Opportunities tab
- Show data table with scores
- Apply filters

**NARRATION:**
```
"Here's your daily feed of high-potential markets.

[Point to table]

Every row is a ZIP code ranked by opportunity score. You can see the composite score here, plus breakdowns by factor.

[Hover over row]

Notice ZIP 78660 - Pflugerville, Texas - scoring 72.4. That's appreciation of 8.3%, homes selling in just 18 days, and a healthy value gap.

[Apply filter]

Let's filter to ZIPs above $200K and scores above 65...

[Results update]

Now we've got a focused list of 347 prime opportunities.

You can also filter by state or metro if you prefer specific geographies."
```

**Callouts:**
- Circle the composite score column
- Highlight the filter controls
- Show result count changing

#### Part B: Geographic View (2:15 - 2:45)

**On Screen:**
- Navigate to Geographic View
- Show choropleth map
- Hover over states

**NARRATION:**
```
"The geographic view shows WHERE opportunities are concentrated.

[Point to map]

Right now, we're seeing hot spots in Texas, Florida, and the Southeast. The darker the color, the higher the average score.

[Click on Texas]

Drilling into Texas, we can see which metros have the best opportunity density.

This replaces hours of manual geographic research with a single glance."
```

**Callouts:**
- Highlight hotspots on map
- Show metro ranking

#### Part C: Market Trends (2:45 - 3:30)

**On Screen:**
- Navigate to Market Trends
- Show time series chart
- Discuss trajectory

**NARRATION:**
```
"Market Trends shows you how scores are changing over time.

[Point to chart]

This is critical - you don't just want today's hot markets. You want markets that are GETTING hotter.

[Point to upward trend]

See this ZIP? Score was 58 three months ago, now it's 71. That's a market on the move - and most flippers won't notice until it's too late.

[Point to downward trend]

Compare that to this one - score dropping from 65 to 52. That's a market to avoid, even if it looks good on paper today."
```

**Callouts:**
- Arrow pointing to rising trend
- Warning icon on declining trend

---

- Analysis performs deep dives
- Alerting generates notifications
- Reporting creates weekly summaries

[Point to alerts]

When something important happens, you get an alert. HOT alerts are priority - scores above 70 or significant changes.

[Click on alert]

Each alert tells you WHY it triggered and WHAT to do next.

[Show Property Deep Dive]

And with one click, you get a full analysis: trend direction, momentum score, risk assessment, and investment recommendation.

What used to take 30 minutes of research now takes 3 seconds."
