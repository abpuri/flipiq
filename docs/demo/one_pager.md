### The Problem (Left column top)
```
House flippers spend 40+ hours per month researching markets - and still miss 80% of emerging opportunities.

Current tools are reactive. You search. You filter. You wait. By the time you spot a hot market, your competition has already moved in.

The result: Missed deals, wasted time, and money left on the table.
```

```
FlipIQ is different.

Opportunities come to YOU. Not the other way around.
