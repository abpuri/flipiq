# FlipIQ Customer Validation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our customer validation approach for FlipIQ. The goal is to determine product-market fit before significant investment in development and marketing.

---

## Validation Objectives

### Primary Question
**"Will house flippers pay for AI-powered opportunity detection?"**

### Secondary Questions
1. What price point maximizes adoption and revenue?
2. Which features are must-haves vs nice-to-haves?
3. Who is our ideal customer profile (ICP)?
4. What channels work best for acquisition?

## Validation Targets

### Quantitative Goals
